# CTFs Writeups

Writeups of CTFs that we created or participated in.

## Why use this repo and not the official writeups?

As a beginner, I had difficult times understanding some of the CTFs writeups that I participated in. This was because most of the writeups didn't contain the original files/binaries/executables that were provided by the challenge, so I couldn't solve it by myself reading the writeup.

So in other words:

- These writeups are focused on beginners, we try to explain every detail of how we solved the challenges and why we took the decisions. Trying to explain all of the thinking processes behind a solution works a lot for beginners.

- We try to provide all the files provided by the challenge, or in cases like web stuff that is not easily replicable, we try to provide screenshots of we solve it. The intent is to try to solve again the challenge following the writeup provided.
