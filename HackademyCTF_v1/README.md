# HackademyCTF v1

This is the first edition of the HackademyCTF in collaboration with Manguito Blue.

All of the challenges proposed in this event were focused for beginners in order to show them some of the basic techniques and strategies in the cybersec world.

All the event was redacted in spanish for a more familiar approach to the challenges.
