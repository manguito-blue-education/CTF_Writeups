# Files Provided

```
flags.txt
```

# Procedure

After viewing the `flag.txt` we can see that is filled with only 0 and 1s. This is means that is just probably a binary representation of an ASCII based text. 

After using an [online binary to ASCII converter](https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/binary-to-ascii.html) we can copy and paste there the content of the txt file and get the flag.

# Flag
