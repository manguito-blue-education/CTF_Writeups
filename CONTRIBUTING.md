# Contributions

All contributions are welcomed! 

Please follow these instructions:

## Structure

Please upload your writeup inside the folder of the event.
If you're creating a folder for an event that is not already on the repo, please upload a `README.md` in the main event folder so we can know more about the event and the context where it was created. 

Please upload the writeups in the `Challenges` folder inside the `Category` name inside the event folder. 

Example:

```
AwesomeCTF
├── Challenges
│   ├── Category1
│       ├── Challenge1
│       │   └── README.md
│       │   └── fileProvided.txt
│       └── Challenge2
│           └── README.md
│           └── fileProvided.exe
├── README.md
```

## Explanation

Try to explain with as much detail as possible each solution. Think that the person who is reading the writeup is a beginner and may not know as much as you.

## Files provided

Please upload all the files provided for the challenge, so the people who are reading the writeup can solve the challenge themselves as they are reading the writeup.
